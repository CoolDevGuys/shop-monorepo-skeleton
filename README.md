# shop-monorepo-skeleton
A PHP backend mono-repository (multiple applications) template that (intends to ðŸ˜…) follows good and clean practices implementing
DDD (Domain Driven Design) using a hexagonal architecture and Symfony 5 as base framework.
The project contains 2 applications (bounded contexts) both related to a Shop and its administration:
- Dashboard (backend)
- Shop (backend)

In this example the Domain is a shop that handles/sells products, and a dashboard to see some insights and administrate resources. 

We try to keep the dependencies to the minimum, so the template can be as much reusable as possible
